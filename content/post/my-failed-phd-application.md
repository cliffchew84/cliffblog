## Urban Researcher
I grew a strong interest in urban issues during my university days. I learned how city planners can enable the provision of quality basic housing and access to employment to its population. And I learned that globally, with more people converging to urban areas, efficient urban policy research and planning can have a huge direct impact on a lot of people. With this belief in the impact of urban planning, I began applying to PhD programmes in urban public policy after my Master’s programme. This post is about one such PhD application and it's related research topic.

## Application Process
PhD applications require a lot of effort. You get referral letters from professors, take the GRE (Graduate Requirement Examination), write personal statements on your research aspirations, and in some cases, have a draft research topic. You will also have to search for programmes with professors who can supervise you on your research topic. And doing all these while thinking about life after your programme, which is when you are officially over-qualified for most jobs in this world.

The thought process of my PhD application was this: 
1. I wanted an overseas PhD to add diversity to my education profile which was all Singapore.
1. My grades were not exemplary, so I targeted universities with mid-range reputations known for their urban planning programmes.
1. From these programmes, I looked for professors with similar interest in urban housing.

The [HKU Department of Urban Planning and Design](https://www.arch.hku.hk/programmes/upad/mphil-and-phd-upd/) got me really excited because it matched all my criteria in a PhD programme, including a professor that matched my research interest. As applicants could include a supporting professor in the university’s PhD application (I assumed this improved our chances), I emailed her my research proposal to seek her support.

## Research topic
I first remembered hearing family and friends discussing about the impact of changes in political parties on home prices, but this was also a topic studied and discussed by [academics](https://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/ecswong/publications/jhe.pdf) and [non-academics](https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/do-opposition-grc-properties-appreciate-less/). Basically, housing prices are affected by neighbouring amenities, and if the ruling party priorities the provision and maintenance of amenities for their own constituencies, housing prices in opposition party constituencies could be lower than houses in the the ruling party constituencies when we control for all other factors.

The 2011 Singapore General Elections saw an unprecedented outcome, where two constituencies switched political sides: Aljunied from ruling to opposition and Potong Pasir from opposition to ruling. Building from my [Master’s thesis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_uG1qGMc6kO_X2Evgk-4N5OxsJqEavTThTOFnUya-oo/edit), I felt the outcome of the 2011 elections provided a natural experiment to study the impact of changing political affiliations on home prices.

## The process
Following this email, the professor and I had some email correspondences and a phone interview, before finally leading to this reply from her.

I readily agreed to her suggestions and I submitted my PhD application to HKU. This took place in late 2012, and unfortunately in July 2013, I received the news that I didn’t make the cut, reason being the application cohort was too competitive. This rejection made me finally give up on the pursuit of a PhD programme. I felt that any lesser programme wouldn’t be worth the time, and I was generally quite bummed from many rejections. Having my hopes up but eventually not getting in was quite a blow to me back then.

## Life thereafter
While I lost hope on pursuing a PhD, I still wanted a career with elements of research. This was something already evident to during my Master's programme, and even more so during my PhD applications. Fortunately for me, that was also the time when I realised about the increasing demand for data science in the private sector (this was in 2013). Back then, from what I could infer, data analysis projects looked like bite-size research projects. You set up a research statement, gather, process and analyse the data, and eventually reach some conclusion. Just that compared to academic research, private corporations cannot wait years for this cycle to complete. And while I have since learned more about the many similarities and differences between empirical academic research and data science work, something that I feel deserves a post itself, entering the data science industry has been quite a rewarding experience.

Writing and sharing such posts was a challenge that I set for myself this year. I have gone through several years of jumping through different learnings, projects, and positions. But I wanted to take time this year to review my experiences, gather my thoughts, and give me some philosophical foundation to build on moving forward. I intend to share more personal stories on data, research, tech, startup and urban related issues. So if you guys like my sharings, please feel free to share them or connect with me on Linkedin.
