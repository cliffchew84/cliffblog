## Urban Researcher
I grew a strong interest in urban issues during my university days. I learned how city planners can enable the provision of quality basic housing and access to employment to its population. And I learned that globally, with more people converging to urban areas, efficient urban policy research and planning can have a huge direct impact on many populations. With this strong conviction in the impact of urban planning, I began applying to PhD programmes in urban public policy after my Master’s programme. In this post, I will write about my interest in urban issues through one of my PhD programme applications.

## Application Process
PhD applications require a lot of effort. You get academic referral letters from university professors, take the GRE (Graduate Requirement Examination), write personal statements on your research or academic aspirations, and in some cases, even have a research thesis proposal ready. You will also have to search for quality programmes with professors who can supervise you on your research topic. And doing all these while thinking about life after your programme, when you officially make yourself over-qualify for most jobs in the world.

The thought process of my PhD application was as follows: 
Having all my education in Singapore, I wanted an overseas PhD to add diversity to my profile. 
My grades were not exemplary, so I targeted universities with mid-range reputations (non-Ivy League schools) known for their urban planning and policy programmes.
From some of these programmes, I hunted down professors with similar research interest. By then, I already had a topic in mind that was about urban housing prices in Singapore.

One of the programmes that got me really excited was from the [HKU Department of Urban Planning and Design](https://www.arch.hku.hk/programmes/upad/mphil-and-phd-upd/). I even found a professor who matched my research interest! So I emailed her to seek her support for my application. This was an option at the university’s PhD application page. I assumed this can improve my chances of getting into the programme.

## Research topic
I remember anecdotal experiences of hearing family members and friends discussing their home prices drop if their constituencies changed from the ruling party to the opposition party. This topic of political boundaries affecting housing prices has also been studied by [academicians](https://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/ecswong/publications/jhe.pdf) and [non-academicians](https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/do-opposition-grc-properties-appreciate-less/). Basically, housing prices are affected by its neighbouring amenities, and if the ruling party priorities the provision and maintenance of amenities for their own constituencies, housing prices in opposition party constituencies could be lower when we control for all other factors.

The 2011 Singapore General Elections saw an unprecedented outcome, where two constituencies switched political sides: Aljunied from ruling to opposition and Potong Pasir from opposition to ruling. Building from my master’s thesis (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_uG1qGMc6kO_X2Evgk-4N5OxsJqEavTThTOFnUya-oo/edit), I felt the outcome of the 2011 elections provided a natural experiment to study the impact of changing political affiliations on home prices. 

## The process
Following this email, I had some email correspondences and a phone interview with the professor, leading up to this email reply from her.

I readily agreed to her suggestions and I submitted my PhD application to HKU. This took place in late 2012, and unfortunately in July 2013, I received the news that I didn’t make the cut, reason being the application cohort was too competitive. This rejection made me finally give up on the pursuit of a PhD programme. I felt that any lesser programme wouldn’t be worth the time, and I was generally quite bummed from many rejections. Having my hopes up but eventually not getting in was quite a blow to me back then.

## Life thereafter
While I lost hope on pursuing a PhD, I still wanted a career with elements of research. This was something even more evident to me when I was doing my PhD applications. Fortunately for me, that was also the time when I realised about the increasing demand for data science in the private sector (this was in 2013). Back then, from what I could infer, data analysis projects looked like bite-size research projects. You set up a research statement, gather, process and analyse the data, and eventually reach some conclusion. Just that compared to academic research, private corporations cannot wait years for this cycle to complete. And while I have since learned more about the many similarities and differences between empirical academic research and data science work, something that I feel deserves a post itself, entering the data science industry has been quite a rewarding experience.

Writing and sharing such posts was a challenge that I set for myself this year. I have gone through several years of jumping through different learnings, projects, and positions, but I wanted to take time to review my experiences, gather my thoughts, and give me some philosophical foundation to build on moving forward. I intend to share more personal stories on data, research, tech, startup and urban related issues. So if you guys like my sharings, please feel free to share them or connect with me on Linkedin.
