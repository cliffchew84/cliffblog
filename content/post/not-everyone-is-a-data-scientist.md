When I joined my first startup in 2016 as a data analyst, I wanted to eventually become a data scientist. Fast forward to 2020, I am now a senior data analyst in a different tech company. While I didn’t achieve my goal in the end, my 4-year data science journey made me realise how narrow my initial view of this industry was. **Hence, in this post, I want to share some of my experiences as a data analyst and shed some light on this industry for people who are interested in data science as a career.**

## An accidental pseudo data engineer
My first analytics role was as a digital marketing data analyst in a Singapore tech startup, and my first task was to calculate the efficiency of our digital marketing spends. The objective looked clear, until I realised I needed to get the data from the servers of Facebook, Google and our mobile attribution partner. And this had to be done at scale because I had to create different reports for 7 different markets. My data analyst career started off with extracting and storing data in proper data tables. **I became an accidental pseudo data engineer,** a job that I still feel needs more recognition for their work, because data science cannot happen without data! Data don’t magically appear into our databases. They have to be captured, tracked, processed and finally ingested into our databases before data analysts and scientists can work on them. To me, this is the start of the data value chain that I hope more people can appreciate.

> Fun fact: Our first data scientist did most of the initial data engineering because our only data engineer back then was busy with some other tasks.

## Data without domain knowledge is useless
A lot of my analytics work also involves understanding the objectives of my stakeholders. **And to solve the many business problems thrown at me, I needed to have a good mix of domain and data knowledge.** At times, this meant proposing alternative solutions that were based on what was feasible within our systems. In other instances, it would be injecting context and refining data requests from “extract users who recently visited our app” to “extract users who logged in into our app for at least 1 minute in the past 7 days”.

On the other hand, I also worked with engineers to understand what our systems are capable of. Do we get our data in a timely manner so that we can send real-time push notifications to our users when we have a sale? How do we integrate our different data sources to form a customer 360 view for better integrated marketing campaigns? Do we have the data and mechanisms to flag out fraudulent app installs? Many of these questions required me to understand the technologies behind our systems, while also translating them into business solutions for my stakeholders.

I did do some work relating to predictive modeling, but my involvement entails identifying the objectives of the model with the data scientists from a domain knowledge perspective, and evaluating the usefulness of our final data product.

## Career progression
**Data analysts do grow into data scientists roles,** but such cases are dependent on available opportunities and exposure, and are by default not built into the career paths of data analysts. Data analysts usually become senior data analysts, where they are expected to contribute to larger analytics projects with his experience, before being promoted to lead / principal data analysts, where they lead analytics teams in particular functions.

I have also heard of instances where data analysts utilise their domain knowledge and progress to become product managers. While these roles focus on different aspects, the use of data to identify insights is something that cuts across both positions. In fact, sensitivities to data is something I feel that is important in many modern day jobs. I myself did consider becoming a digital marketing product manager or marketing technologist as well, but after much deliberation, I decided that I was more comfortable progressing to be a senior data analyst instead.

> Fun fact: I had 2 analytics interns that are working as data engineers now. And both were economics majors who learned their data engineering skills on the job.

## Conclusion
I can only provide a glimpse of what this industry is like with a post. Don’t be mistaken and think that this post is attacking data scientists. I do know many data scientists are doing great work, and they are important to their companies. But as I look at the many boot camps and courses that want to train data scientists within a few months, I feel the value of the data science industry is deeply twisted by many of these marketing messages. And I worry that more Singaporeans are joining this industry with unrealistic expectations, just like how I was when I started out in 2016. I hope that more Singaporeans who are keen in this industry can realise that this is a really diverse field, **and that not everyone in data science is a data scientist.**
