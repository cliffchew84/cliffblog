My first academic love was Economics, but I ended up becoming a data analyst due to my love for data. My experience as a data analyst in different tech startups have equipped me with some interesting technical skills. With these skills, I hope to be able to use data to investigate certain social dynamics and issues that hold dear to me. This is the lean version for creating this blog.

If things seem interesting so far, consider reading the longer entry of ‘About Me”, as that will go deeper into my background and the topics that I hope to write here.
