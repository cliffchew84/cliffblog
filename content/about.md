I am a Singaporean, an NUS Economics degree holder who has worked in a few tech companies as a data analyst for a few years. I have worked as a civil servant and a researcher, and have worked with economists, sociologists, geographers, statisticians, architects, digital marketers, designers, fraud analysts, data engineers, data scientists and fellow data analysts. For some time now, I have a strong urge to share my experiences, thoughts and side projects across these different lives. This is the purpose of this blog. And the purpose of this post is to highlight some interesting aspects of my life to explain why my blog could interest some readers.

## An Urban Researcher
At NUS, my interest was in urban economics and housing policies. I got a minor in Urban Studies. I studied the impact of a subway construction on neighbouring housing prices for my Masters thesis. I even applied for a PhD programme with a research proposal to study how political boundaries affect Singapore housing prices.

Researchers have praised Singapore for our successful housing policies. The onset of Singapore’s public housing policies in the 70s cleaned up unsanitized slums for efficient urban developments, while rehousing residents in public housing estates that had good accessibility to amenities. As of 2020, Singapore is achieving near zero homelessness and having most residents owning the homes that they are living in.

While Singapore’s housing policies are not all perfect, our housing achievements seem to go against a trend of housing woes across major global cities. I believe that quality housing directly affects quality of life, and that quality housing policies have far-reaching positive consequences to a society. So, even though I didn’t pursue my PhD in the end, my belief on the positive impact of good housing and urban policies that have kept my interests in them till this day.

## A Data Analyst
It took me a few years after killing off my PhD dreams before landing a data analyst job at a local tech startup. I knew enough statistics from Economics to get by, but had to learn some Python programming and SQL on my own before landing this position. Even till now, the learning never stops.

As a data analyst, I learned stuff beyond my wildest imagination as a social science major. Technical details on databases, APIs, real-time streaming, cloud computing, data tracking, callbacks to computer science concepts like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid). And while I do enough Python coding to fool the uninitiated, I keep the principle that I learn enough to be functional at work, but will never see myself as a programmer. Rather, I see my strength in data, skills in coding and ability to mash them with my social science background.

## Moving forward
In this blog, I will share my interests in data, urban policies, philosophy, society and many others. Some posts will be thoughts and personal experiences, while some will be a series of data and programming side projects. By penning my thoughts and experiences, I hope to pique the interests of people in these topics, bring out certain issues that I think are important, and hopefully make a positive impact on people’s lives and my society.
