My first academic love was Economics, but I ended up becoming a data analyst due to my love for data. Because of this, I have had the fortunate experience of working with different groups of technical and non-technical people. While solving technical data problems fuels my stomach, investigating social dynamics and issues with data fuels my soul. It is this passion that has led to me creating this blog.

If what I have written so far has interested you, do look at my longer ‘About Me” entry about my background and topics that I hope to think about loud in this blog.
